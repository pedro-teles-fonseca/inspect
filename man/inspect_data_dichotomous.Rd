\title{Validate dichotomous data}
\usage{
inspect_data_dichotomous(data, success, allow_nas = TRUE, warning_nas = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data, success}{Arbitrary objects. \code{success} is meant to indicate the value of \code{data} that corresponds to a success.}

\item{allow_nas}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE} then \code{NA} and \code{NaN} values in \code{data} are allowed. If \code{FALSE}, execution is stopped and an error message is thrown in case there are \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values in \code{data}.}

\item{warning_nas}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE} then the presence of \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values in \code{data} generates a warning message. \code{NA} and \code{NaN} values pass silently otherwise (if \code{allow_nas} is set to\code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
\code{inspect_data_dichotomous} does not return any output. There are three possible outcomes:
\itemize{
\item The call is silent if:
\itemize{
\item \code{data} is eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials and there are no \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values in \code{data}.
\item \code{data} is eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials, there are some \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values in \code{data}, \code{allow_nas} is set to \code{TRUE} and \code{warning_nas} is set to \code{FALSE}.
}
\item An informative warning message is thrown if:
\itemize{
\item \code{data} is eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials and \code{success} is not observed in \code{data}.
\item \code{data} is eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials, there are \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values in \code{data} and both \code{allow_nas} and \code{warning_nas} are set to \code{TRUE}.
}
\item An informative error message is thrown and the execution is stopped if:
\itemize{
\item \code{data} is not eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials.
\item \code{data} is eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials, there are some \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values in \code{data} and \code{allow_nas} is set to \code{FALSE}.
}
}
}
\description{
\code{inspect_data_dichotomous} checks if an object contains data that is eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials. This can be useful to validate inputs in user-defined functions.
}
\details{
\code{inspect_data_dichotomous} conducts a series of tests to check if \code{data} is eligible to have been generated by a series of Bernoulli trials. Namely, \code{inspect_data_dichotomous} checks if:
\itemize{
\item \code{data} and \code{success} are \code{NULL} or empty.
\item \code{data} and \code{success} are atomic and have an eligible data type (logical, integer, double, character).
\item \code{data} and \code{success} have \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values.
\item The number of unique values in \code{data} and \code{success} are adequate.
\item \code{success} has \code{\link[base]{length}} 1.
\item \code{success} is observed in \code{data}.
}

# Calls that pass silently:

x5 <- c(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, NA)
